## 🧰 Build Windows Installer (.exe)

This repository includes `build-installer.ps1` to create an installable Windows `.exe` using `jpackage`.

It will:

* Compile all Java files from `source/`
* Create `Minhaj-Mario.jar`
* Copy `images/` and `maps/`
* Build installer output in `dist/`

Run from project root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-installer.ps1
```

If WiX is not installed, you can still build a portable package (contains `Minhaj-Mario.exe`) with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-installer.ps1 -PackageType app-image
```

Portable output path:

* `dist/Minhaj-Mario/Minhaj-Mario.exe`

After completion, install using the `.exe` file generated inside the `dist/` folder.

### 🚀 Publish `.exe` via GitHub Releases

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/release-exe.yml`.

* On pushing a tag like `v1.0.0`, it builds and publishes two assets.
* `Minhaj-Mario-installer-vX.Y.Z.exe` (**installer**)
* `Minhaj-Mario-portable-vX.Y.Z.zip` (**portable build**, no install wizard)
* You can also run it manually from the **Actions** tab.

### 📦 Which file should users download?

From **GitHub Releases**:

* Use `Minhaj-Mario-installer-vX.Y.Z.exe` if you want normal Windows installation.
* Use `Minhaj-Mario-portable-vX.Y.Z.zip` if you want a portable version; extract and run `Minhaj-Mario.exe` from the extracted folder.

> ⚠️ Do not download a standalone launcher `.exe` from inside an app-image folder by itself. It needs its bundled runtime files next to it.

Example tag flow:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
